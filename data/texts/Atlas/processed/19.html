<a class="headerlink" href="#section-1simpleandcompoundinterrogativepronouns" title="Permalink to this section">¶</a></h3><p class="western c12">All languages
have interrogative pronouns for asking content questions, such as
‘who’, ‘what’, ‘where’, ‘when’, and ‘how’ (<a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="idiatov2007">Idiatov 2007</a>). In
addition, languages normally have adnominal interrogative words
such as ‘which’ that allow speakers to form complex interrogative
noun phrases such as ‘which house’ or ‘which girl’.</p><p class="western c16"><span class="c13">In this chapter, we focus on the contrast between two kinds
of interrogative pronouns:</span> <span class="c14">simple
interrogative pronouns</span> <span class="c13">(monomorphemic
words such as English</span> <span class="c15">who,
how</span><span class="c13">, or Spanish</span> <span class="c15">quién, dónde</span><span class="c13">) and</span>
<span class="c14">compound interrogative pronouns</span>
<span class="c13">which are composed of an adnominal interrogative
word and a</span> <span class="c14">generic noun</span>
<span class="c13">for one of the ontological categories (person,
thing, place, time, manner). Such compound interrogatives are
found, for example, in <a href="/contributions/50">Guadeloupean Creole</a> (Colot &amp; Ludwig
2013a), which contrasts strikingly with its French
lexifier:</span></p><p class="c12">(1) <i>ki moun</i>
[which person] ‘who’ (cf. <i>qui</i>)</p><p class="c12"><i>ki koté</i> [which
side] ‘where’ (cf. <i>où</i>)</p><p class="c12"><i>ki tan</i> [which
time] ‘when’ (cf. <i>quand</i>)</p><p class="c12"><i>ki jan</i> [which
kind] ‘how’ (cf. <i>comment</i>)</p><p class="c12">It is well known that
pidgin and creole languages often replace the simple interrogatives
of the lexifiers with such compounds consisting of adnominal
interrogatives and generic nouns (<a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="muyskensmith1990">Muysken &amp; Smith 1990</a>,
<a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="clementsmahboob2000">Clements &amp; Mahboob 2000</a>). This chapter shows the extent to
which different languages use simple and compound interrogatives.
It has sometimes been claimed that compound interrogatives in
Atlantic pidgins and creoles are due to African substrate
languages, but this explanation works only for some of the
languages. A more general (but more difficult to test) explanation
is that compound interrogatives are due to the tendency for pidgins
and creoles to exhibit transparent structures (<a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="seurenwekker1986">Seuren &amp; Wekker
1986</a>).</p><h3 class="western c12" id="section-2thevalues"><span class="c10">2. The values</span>

<a class="headerlink" href="#section-2thevalues" title="Permalink to this section">¶</a></h3><p class="c12">We concentrate our
attention on the counterparts of the four interrogatives ‘who’,
‘where’, ‘when’, and ‘how’. Others such as ‘what’, ‘why’ and ‘how
much’ could have been added but were not taken into account here
because they show less variation, ‘what’ being almost always
simple, and ‘why’ and ‘how much’ compound in most cases. While the
lexifiers generally have simple interrogatives, most of the
<i>APiCS</i> languages have at least one compound interrogative
pronoun among these four. (It should be noted that what is said
about the relationship between pidgins/creoles and lexifiers here
relates mostly to the European lexifiers; some of the non-European
lexifiers may themselves have compound expressions for some of the
categories.)</p><p class="western c17">1. All simple
words 22</p><p class="western c17">2. One
compound expression 18</p><p class="western c17">3. Two
compound expressions 17</p><p class="western c17">4. Three
compound expressions 10</p><p class="western c17">5. Four
compound expressions 7</p><p class="c12">Not suprisingly,
languages with relatively little distance to the lexifier tend to
have four simple words (e.g. <a href="/contributions/29">Afrikaans</a>, <a href="/contributions/54">Reunion Creole</a>, <a href="/contributions/21">Singlish</a>,
<a href="/contributions/14">African American English</a>, <a href="/contributions/26">Hawai‘i Creole</a>, <a href="/contributions/13">Gullah</a>), as do the mixed
languages <a href="/contributions/75">Michif</a> and <a href="/contributions/62">Mixed Ma’a/Mbugu</a>. Also, the Arabic-based
languages and <a href="/contributions/58">Kikongo-Kituba</a> lack compound interrogatives. The
languages that most strongly favour compound interrogatives are the
Atlantic English-based and French-based creoles. Spanish-based and
Portuguese-based languages generally preserve the simple forms
better. In the English-based languages, influence from English is
often leading to a replacement of compound forms by English-like
simple forms.</p><h3 class="c12" id="section-3differentontologicalcategories"><span class="c10">3.
Different ontological categories</span>

<a class="headerlink" href="#section-3differentontologicalcategories" title="Permalink to this section">¶</a></h3><p class="c12">The four ontological
categories (person, place, time, manner) differ in their propensity
to occur as simple or compound interrogatives. The category that
most strongly favours compound expression is time: More than two
dozen languages have ‘what time’ or ‘which hour’ instead of ‘when’
in the lexifier, e.g.</p><blockquote class="example" style="font-size:100%;padding-left:1.8em;margin-left:0.3em"><p class="c12" style="text-indent:-2em">(2) <a href="/contributions/68">Ambon Malay</a> <i>apa
tempo</i> [which time]</p><p class="c12"><a href="/contributions/36">Angolar</a> <i>ora
kutxi</i> [hour which]</p><p class="c12">Cape Verdean Creole
<i>ki tenpu</i> [which time]</p><p class="c12"><a href="/contributions/37">Principense</a> <i>ki

<i>what time</i> [what time]</p><p class="c12"><a href="/contributions/23">Bislama</a> <i>wanem

níni</i> [moment which]</p><p class="c12"><a href="/contributions/61">Fanakalo</a> <i>(y)ini
skati</i> [which time]</p></blockquote><p class="c12">The category that is
the most resistant to replacement by an adnominal form plus generic
noun is ‘what’, followed by ‘who’. But Atlantic English-based
languages not uncommonly have forms such as <span class="c19">wiʧpɛsin/wiʧman</span> <span class="c20">(<a href="/contributions/16">Ghanaian Pidgin English</a>),</span>
<span class="c19">husman</span>
<span class="c20">(<a href="/contributions/18">Cameroon Pidgin English</a>),</span> <span class="c19">wich badi/huu badi</span> <span class="c20">(<a href="/contributions/5">Creolese</a>), and French-based languages have forms
like</span> <span class="c19">ki
moun</span> <span class="c20">(from
French</span> <span class="c19">monde</span> <span class="c20">‘world, people, person’).</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c20">The interrogatives ‘where’ and ‘how’
are intermediate. ‘Where’ is commonly replaced by ‘what place’ or
similar forms:</span></p><p class="c12"><span>(3) <a href="/contributions/7">Vincentian Creole</a></span> <span class="c21">wich paa(t)</span> <span>[which part]</span></p><p class="c12"><span><a href="/contributions/18">Cameroon Pidgin English</a></span> <span class="c21">hu-say</span> <span>[which-side]</span></p><p class="c12"><span><a href="/contributions/42">Papiá Kristang</a></span> <span class="c21">ki banda</span> <span>[what side]</span></p><p class="c12"><span><a href="/contributions/33">Guinea-Bissau Kriyol</a></span> <span class="c21">na kal ladu</span> <span>[in which side]</span></p><p class="c16">‘<span class="c13">How’ is commonly replaced by
‘what manner’ or similar forms:</span></p><blockquote class="example" style="font-size:100%;padding-left:1.8em;margin-left:0.3em"><p class="c12" style="text-indent:-2em"><span>(4) <a href="/contributions/56">Seychelles Creole</a></span> <span class="c21">ki mannyer</span> <span>[what manner]</span></p><p class="c12"><span><a href="/contributions/22">Tok Pisin</a></span> <span class="c21">olsem wanem</span> <span>[like what]</span></p><p class="c12"><span><a href="/contributions/43">Batavia Creole</a></span> <span class="c21">ki-lay</span> <span>[what-sort]</span></p></blockquote><h3 class="c12" id="section-4degreesofcompoundness"><span class="c10">4.

<a href="#top" style="vertical-align: bottom" title="go to top of the page">⇫</a>
<a class="headerlink" href="#section-4degreesofcompoundness" title="Permalink to this section">¶</a></h3><p class="c12"><span>Whether a form is regarded as compound or not is
decided by its shape, not by evidence for analyzability by the
speaker. Maurer (2013b) notes that <a href="/contributions/43">Batavia Creole</a></span>
<span class="c21">kilay</span>
<span>‘how’ is always written as one
word and also occurs with the shape</span> <span class="c21">klay</span><span>. This suggests that synchronically this form is
unanalyzable. But as long as the generic noun</span> <span class="c21">lay</span> <span>still exists in the language and has a similar
form as the relevant part of the interrogative pronoun, we regard
them as compound.</span></p><p class="c16"><a id="OLE_LINK2" name="OLE_LINK2"></a><a id="OLE_LINK3" name="OLE_LINK3"></a>
<span class="c13"><span>If
compoundness were defined purely in terms of morphological
complexity, then even English</span> <span class="c21">when, where</span><span>, etc. could be analyzed as</span> <span class="c21">wh-en</span> <span>[</span><span class="c22">interrog-temp</span><span>],</span> <span class="c21">wh-ere</span> <span>[</span><span class="c22">interrog-loc</span><span>],
etc. But we require identity of the generic noun with a noun with
similar meaning in the language. Thus, <a href="/contributions/28">Berbice Dutch</a></span>
<span class="c21">wanga</span><span>, which
historically derives from</span> <span class="c21">wa-</span><span class="c18">anga</span> <span class="c23">[what-place], is regarded as simple, because</span>
<span class="c18">anga</span>
<span class="c23">‘place’ no longer
occurs in the language (Kouwenberg 2013a). Similarly, <a href="/contributions/40">Korlai</a></span>
<span class="c18">k</span><span class="c18">ɔr</span> <span class="c23">‘</span><span class="c23">when’ (&lt; Portuguese</span> <span class="c18">que hora</span><span class="c23">) and</span> <span class="c18">kil</span><span class="c18">ɛ</span> <span class="c23">‘</span><span class="c23">how’ (&lt;</span> <span class="c18">que laia</span> <span class="c23">‘</span><span class="c23">what kind’) are no longer compound.</span> <span class="c23">But such cases of secondary
opacity of interrogatives are not common. The adnominal
interrogative word more often becomes</span> <span>opaque (e.g. in <a href="/contributions/19">Pichi</a></span> <span class="c21">us-,</span> <span>e.g.</span> <span class="c21">us-say</span> <span>‘where’,</span> <span class="c21">us-t</span><span class="c18">ɛn</span> <span>‘</span><span class="c23">when’,</span> <span class="c18">us-pɔsin</span> <span>‘</span><span class="c23">who’, deriving from</span> <span class="c18">which</span> <span class="c23">via a form</span> <span class="c18">utʃ</span><span class="c23">), but forms with an opaque adnominal element are still
regarded as complex.</span></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c23">Sometimes the adnominal element
disappears completely, so that only the original generic noun is
left, e.g. <a href="/contributions/51">Martinican Creole</a></span> <span class="c18">koté</span> <span>‘where’ (originally</span> <span class="c21">ki koté</span> <span>[which place], which is still possible, Colot &amp; Ludwig
2013b). Such cases are considered to be simple interrogatives, but
there are few cases of such “secondarily simple” forms that no
longer occur side by side with the original complex form (e.g.
<a href="/contributions/2">Sranan</a></span> <span class="c21">suma</span> <span>‘who’</span> <span class="c21">&lt; hu-soma</span> <span>[which-person], <a href="/contributions/36">Angolar</a></span> <span class="c21">ngê</span> <span>‘who’ &lt; [person(+which)]).</span></p><p class="c16"><a id="OLE_LINK4" name="OLE_LINK4"></a> <span class="c13"><span class="c23">Note also that morphological elements that
are neither (similar to) generic nouns nor (similar to) adnominal
interrogatives are disregarded, as in <a href="/contributions/13">Gullah</a></span> <span class="c18">whodat</span> <span>‘</span><span class="c23">who’ (presumably &lt;</span> <span class="c18">who + that</span><span class="c23">), <a href="/contributions/54">Reunion Creole</a></span> <span class="c18">ki sa</span> <span>‘</span><span class="c23">who’ (presumably &lt;</span> <span class="c18">qui + ça</span><span class="c23">), <a href="/contributions/47">Papiamentu</a></span> <span class="c18">na unda</span> <span class="c23">[in where]</span> <span>‘where’.

compound interrogatives</span></span></p><h3 class="c12" id="section-5cooccurrenceofsimpleandcompoundforms"><span class="c10">5. Cooccurrence of simple and

[when-time] ‘when’.</p><p class="c12">Since we are primarily
interested in the compound forms here, cases where both forms occur
are classified in the same way as cases where only compound forms

very uncommon that they are disregarded. Thus, according to
Hagemeijer (2013), “</span><span class="c24">the frequency of compound expressions for 'where' and 'how'

expressions (</span><span class="c18">kê ngê</span> <span class="c23">and</span> <span class="c18">kê ola</span><span class="c23">). Similarly, in present-day <a href="/contributions/10">San Andres Creole English</a>, the
