<a class="headerlink" href="#section-1introduction" title="Permalink to this section">¶</a></h3><p class="c12">This chapter looks at
a phenomenon that does not belong to the standard canon of
linguistic topics: The use of click sounds in languages that do not
make use of clicks as regular phonemes. As Gil (2005c) has shown in
his <i>WALS</i> chapter, this phenomenon is widespread in the
world’s languages, at least in Africa and western and southern
Eurasia. Gil calls such click usages <b>para-linguistic</b>,
because they make use of sounds that do not occur elsewhere in the
language, they express a very restricted range of meanings, and
they are like interjections in that they are not integrated into
the grammatical structure of the language. As a result, they are
sometimes perceived as being nonlinguistic gestures, but it is
important to recognize that their form and meaning differs across
languages, i.e. they are learned together with other linguistic
features.</p><p class="c12">Such click sounds are
not normally written, but in the depiction of lively dialogue,
authors may write the English alveolar click as <i>tsk tsk</i>, or
as <i>tut tut</i>. In phonetic transcription, this would be [ǀ],
using the technical symbols for clicks used by specialists of the
Khoisan languages (which have phonemic clicks). In the following,
however, we will use makeshift transcriptions of the <i>tsk tsk</i>
type, because the precise phonetic characteristics of the click
sounds of the various languages have not been investigated yet.</p><h3 class="c12" id="section-2thefourvalues"><span class="c10">2.

<a class="headerlink" href="#section-2thefourvalues" title="Permalink to this section">¶</a></h3><p class="c12">According to Gil
(2005c), two most prominent para-linguistic usages of clicks are
<b>logical uses</b>, to express affirmation or negation, and
<b>affective uses</b>, to express negative affects (such as
indignation, anger, annoyance) or positive affects (approval or
appreciation). The value box shows the distribution of the
<i>APiCS</i> languages over the four types.</p><p class="western c16"><span class="c14">1.</span> <span class="c14">No para-linguistic clicks</span>

are reported as lacking para-linguistic clicks. It should be noted,
however, that the existence of such clicks requires a very intimate
knowledge of the language in its colloquial form. Thus, for 12
languages in the</span> <span class="c18">APiCS</span> <span class="c17">set, information on this feature is lacking, and it may be
that further study will reveal the existence of clicks also in some
of the languages of type 1.</span></p><p class="c12">Gil (2005c) also
mentions other uses of click sounds, such as in addressing babies
or for interacting with animals, but these seem to be much less
widespread than affective and logical uses and are left aside for
the classification. However, Michaelis &amp; Rosalie (2013) mention
that in <a href="/contributions/56">Seychelles Creole</a>, clicks can be used to court a woman or
for the meaning ‘I got it’. And Meyerhoff (2013) notes that “also
very widespread in Vanuatu is the use of tightly pursed-lipped
ingressives and dental fricatives as a means of summonsing
people.”</p><h3 class="c12" id="section-3affectivemeanings"><span class="c10">3. Affective meanings</span>
<a href="#top" style="vertical-align: bottom" title="go to top of the page">⇫</a>
<a class="headerlink" href="#section-3affectivemeanings" title="Permalink to this section">¶</a></h3><p class="c12"><span class="c17">In the clear majority of languages
where the meanings of para-linguistic clicks have been described,
they express negative affects, such as “anger, anoyance or
exasperation” (<a href="/contributions/14">African American English</a>, Green 2013), “disapproval,
skepticism or frustration” (<a href="/contributions/68">Ambon Malay</a>, Paauw 2013), “doubt,
dismissal, challenge” (<a href="/contributions/9">Belizean Creole</a>, Escure 2013),
“</span><span class="c17">disagreement, reproach, exasperation, or annoyance”
(<a href="/contributions/12">Bahamian Creole</a>, Hackert 2013)</span><span class="c17">. This is thus similar to the use
of</span> <span class="c18">tsk
tsk</span> <span class="c17">in
English and other European languages. However, in many Caribbean
languages, the click sound to express negative affect is quite
different from English, and it has in fact frequently been remarked
upon in the literature as having a distinct character and as being
prominent in the languages. While English has no specific word for
the</span> <span class="c18">tsk
tsk</span> <span class="c17">gesture,
in many English-based Caribbean languages, the expression “suck
teeth” (or sometimes “kiss teeth”) is used for a click sound
expressing negative affect. <a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="rickfordrickford1976">Rickford &amp; Rickford (1976</a>) describe
the use of this gesture in <a href="/contributions/5">Creolese</a> in some detail and claim that
it is very similar in other Caribbean varieties. For example, the
use of the gesture by children in the presence of adults is
generally considered rude. They also note that the African
Americans they interviewed were mostly familiar with the gesture,
while White Americans were not.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c17">Specific words for the “suck-teeth”
gesture have been reported for several languages:</span>
<span class="c18">stchoops</span>

Logical meanings</span>
<a href="#top" style="vertical-align: bottom" title="go to top of the page">⇫</a>
<a class="headerlink" href="#section-4logicalmeanings" title="Permalink to this section">¶</a></h3><p class="c12">In twelve <i>APiCS</i>
languages, a click can be used to express logical meanings, i.e.
negative answers, or rarely positive answers, of polar questions.
There are two languages where <b>only logical meanings</b> (value
3) can be expressed by clicks, <a href="/contributions/39">Diu Indo-Portuguese</a> and <a href="/contributions/48">Palenquero</a>.
Concerning <a href="/contributions/48">Palenquero</a>, Schwegler (2013) observes that
negation-expressing clicks are found in different varieties of its
lexifier Spanish, but since affect-expressing clicks are also found
elsewhere in Hispanic varieties, the situation in <a href="/contributions/48">Palenquero</a> is
surprising after all.</p><p class="c12">In the other ten
languages, <b>clicks can have both logical and affective
meanings</b> (value 4). This does not necessarily mean that a
single click is ambiguous or polysemous. In <a href="/contributions/64">Juba Arabic</a>, for
example, there are two different clicks for the two meanings:
<span class="c17">"The logical meaning ‘yes’ is realized as a
palatal click, while the affective value is realized as a
alveo-palatal click" (Manfredi &amp; Petrollino 2013). In <a href="/contributions/17">Nigerian Pidgin</a>, "alveolar and palatal clicks are used with logical meaning
(‘no’/negation) and lateral clicks are used with affective meaning
(suck teeth/disgust)” (Faraclas 2013).</span> Two further examples
are given in (3).</p><blockquote class="example" id="ex-57-103" style="font-size:100%;padding-left:1.8em;margin-left:0.3em"><p class="c12" style="text-indent:-2em"><span class="c17">(3)

one of the few <i>APiCS</i> languages where a click can be used for
positive answers, but note that there are two different clicks for
positive and negative answers.</p><p class="c12"><span class="c17">In
some languages, the descriptions are not totally clear and the
sound may not be strictly speaking a click. For <a href="/contributions/59">Sango</a>, Samarin
(2013) describes "</span>a labio-dental ingressive fricative that
expresses disgust, disapproval, etc.", and writes it as "ff".
Similarly, Devonish &amp; Thompson (2013) describe the <a href="/contributions/5">Creolese</a>
sound as "an ingressive fricative passing through either the front
teeth, or more often laterally along the side of the mouth and then
through the teeth". Mufwene (2013) says that “<span class="c17">Clicks are not significant in
<a href="/contributions/58">Kikongo-Kituba</a>, although there is a practice of sucking teeth for
displeasure. However, it is not clear whether sucking teeth falls
in the category of clicks.”</span> Clicks are ingressive, but they
always involve two closures and a release of one closure.
<span class="c17">Thus, a study that would take the precise
articulation of these special sounds into account is needed and
would reveal more diversity.</span></p><h3 class="c12" id="section-5geographicaldistributionandsubstrates"><span class="c22">5.

Gil’s (2005c)</span> <span class="c18">WALS</span> <span class="c17">chapter, it seems to be presupposed that having logical

here, because the areas with no or little usage of clicks
(northeastern Eurasia, Americas) have not been important for our
languages. We do not find clear substrate or lexifier effects
either, as African and European languages do not behave very
differently with respect to the simple existence of clicks.
However, <a class="ref-link" style="cursor: pointer;" data-content="rickfordrickford1976">Rickford &amp; Rickford (1976</a>) make a strong case for an
