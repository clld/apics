        The <i>Atlas of Pidgin and Creole Language Structures (APiCS)</i> provides
        expert-based
        information on 130 grammatical and lexical features of 76 pidgin and creole
        languages from around the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was edited by Susanne Maria Michaelis, Philippe Maurer, Martin Haspelmath, and
        Magnus Huber, with crucial support from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary
        Anthropology (Leipzig) and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG).

        The online version contains all the materials from the printed version, plus a
        large number of examples and feature value comments. In addition, it was
        specifically designed to allow comparison with data from <i>WALS (the World Atlas
        of Language Structures)</i>.

    The online <i>APiCS</i> contains three kinds of contributions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="${request.route_url('parameters')}">${stats['parameter']} features and
            chapters</a> dealing with grammatical and lexical features, containing
        information on feature values from up to 76 creole, pidgin and mixed languages;
        each of the chapters was written by one (or sometimes two) of the four editors of
        APiCS. The chapters in the online version are identical to the chapters in the
        book version, but the online version allows direct access to information on each
        feature value for each language.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="${request.route_url('contributions')}">${stats['language']} language
            structure datasets</a> providing information on the 130 features for each
        language, including examples and comments for many of the language-feature
        combinations. The structure datasets are unique to the online version.
    </li>
    <li>
        ## FIXME: link to survey index
        74 language surveys
        giving prose overview of each language, both its
        sociohistorical context and its grammatical properties. The surveys in the online
        version are identical to the survey chapters in the book version.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Since the Atlas chapters and the Survey chapters are identical to the book version,
    they should be cited like the book chapters. However, the language structure datasets
    are unique to the online version, and they should be cited as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
    ${h.newline2br(citation.render(example_contribution, request))|n}
</blockquote>
<p>
    The complete online version, including both the atlas chapters and the surveys, can be
    cited as follows:
