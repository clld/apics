<a class="headerlink" href="#section-1featuredescription" title="Permalink to this section">¶</a></h4><p class="western c13"><span class="c14">Map 116 is about the lexical choices that</span> <span class="c15">APiCS</span> <span class="c14">languages make when referring
to the “cool” colour sensations green and blue, specifically,
whether the</span> <span class="c16">basic colour terms</span>
<span class="c14">for green and blue are identical or different.
The map is based on the corresponding</span> <span class="c15">WALS</span> <span class="c14">chapter by <a class="ref-link" data-content="kaymaffi2005" style="cursor: pointer;">Kay &amp; Maffi
(2005)</a>, who follow <a class="ref-link" data-content="hering1964" style="cursor: pointer;">Hering ([1920] 1964)</a> in proposing a universal of
six primary colour categories (black, white, red, yellow, green,
blue). Languages differ as to how the psychological colour space is
covered by their basic colour terms, i.e. words whose “meaning is
not predictable from the meaning of [their] parts”, whose
“signification is not included in any other color term”, whose
“application must not be restricted to a narrow class of objects”,
and which are “psychologically salient for informants” (<a class="ref-link" data-content="berlinkay1969" style="cursor: pointer;">Berlin
&amp; Kay 1969</a>: 6).</span></p><p class="western c13"><span class="c14">The data for the</span> <span class="c15">World Color
Survey</span> <span class="c14">(see <a class="ref-link" data-content="caycook2010" style="cursor: pointer;">Kay et al. 2010</a>,

(2005)</a></span> <span class="c15">WALS</span> <span class="c14">contribution were collected using objective psychological
methods (to elicit colour terms, a set of 330 Munsell colour chips
were shown to native speakers). It has to be pointed out that
the</span> <span class="c15">APiCS</span> <span class="c14">data is
more impressionistic and results thus have to be treated with some
caution: The contributors were not provided with standardized
colours to show to speakers of the contact languages, and in many
cases the questionnaire answers are based on the
contributor’s</span> <span class="c15">post-hoc</span> <span class="c14">interpretation of field recordings and may therefore be
influenced by the colour system of the contributor’s language.
Nevertheless, Map 116 shows some interesting results that call for
further research.</span></p><p class="western c13"><span class="c14">Note that <a class="ref-link" data-content="kaymaffi2005" style="cursor: pointer;">Kay &amp; Maffi
(2005)</a> “Green and blue” map
includes information on whether these colour terms also cover black
or yellow. This is not the case in</span> <span class="c15">APiCS</span><span class="c14">, which considers the terms for
green and blue only, regardless of whether they also refer to other
colours. From the comments of some</span> <span class="c15">APiCS</span> <span class="c14">contributors it is clear,
however, that in contact languages the terms referring to green and
blue cover other colour sensations too. For example, <a href="/contributions/59">Sango</a></span>
<span class="c15">vuko/voko</span> <span class="c14">means ‘be
dark/black/blue/green/etc.’ (<a href="/contributions/59">Samarin 2013</a>) and <a href="/contributions/40">Korlai</a></span>
<span class="c15">pret</span><span class="c14">, in variation with
Marathi-derived</span> <span class="c15">shahi</span> <span class="c14">‘blue’, refers to ‘black, (dark) blue’ (<a href="/contributions/40">Clements 2013</a>). That
the same term refers to black and blue is a common phenomenon in
the world’s languages and is found in the first four of the five
evolutionary stages of basic colour term systems proposed by <a class="ref-link" data-content="kaymaffi1999" style="cursor: pointer;">Kay
&amp; Maffi (1999</a>: 748); see also §3.</span></p><h4 class="western c12" id="section-2thevalues"><span class="c11">2. The values</span>

<span class="c14">‘green’ from Portuguese or Spanish and</span>

colour terms remain unchanged in the contact language, so that the

<span class="c17">towards European-lexified contact languages (60

value 3 (overlap) languages are all located in Africa, as are the
three non-partition languages (value 4). As far as the
European-lexified contact languages among these are concerned, this
points towards strong substratal/adstratal African influence, a
point that could also be made with regard to the “radical” creole
<a href="/contributions/3">Saramaccan</a> across the Atlantic. With regard to the
African-lexifier</span> <span class="c29">APiCS</span> <span class="c17">languages, this seems to be simply a case of the transfer of
the lexifier colour systems to the contact languages, just as with
the transfer of green–blue differentiation to the European-lexifier
contact languages, discussed above.</span></p><p class="western c13"><span class="c31">The evolution of colour term systems.</span> <span class="c14"><a class="ref-link" data-content="kaymaffi1999" style="cursor: pointer;">Kay &amp; Maffi (1999</a>, 2005) propose a five-stage model of
the evolution of colour term systems in the world’s languages. The
model is only concerned with the six primary colour categories
(black, white, red, yellow, green, blue) and basically predicts a
development from a hypothesized two-term Stage I to Stage V, where
each of the six categories has its own distinct basic colour
term.</span></p><p class="western c13"><span class="c14">Diachronic evidence in</span> <span class="c15">APiCS</span>
<span class="c14">supports the Kay &amp; Maffi model. For example,
<a href="/contributions/1">Early Sranan</a></span> <span class="c15">blakka</span><span class="c14">/</span><span class="c15">brakka</span> <span class="c14">covered both black and blue <a href="/contributions/1">(van den Berg &amp; Bruyn 2013)</a>,
while in Modern <a href="/contributions/2">Sranan</a></span> <span class="c15">blaka</span>
<span class="c14">‘black’ no longer refers to blue (Winford, p.c.).
That is, Modern <a href="/contributions/2">Sranan</a> has entered the last evolutionary stage,
where all six primary colour categories are referred to by separate
basic colour terms.</span></p><p class="western c13"><span class="c14">Diachronic evidence in</span> <span class="c15">APiCS</span>
<span class="c14">also suggests that in terms of the feature
values, the evolution of colour systems may develop from identity
(value 2) via overlap (value 3) into differentiation (value 1).
<a href="/contributions/17">Nigerian Pidgin</a>, for example, has moved from identity to overlap,
probably under lexifier influence: “Formerly, the stative
verb</span> <span class="c15">blak</span> <span class="c14">was
used to refer to the spectrum from black to purple to blue to
green, but now the separate stative verbs</span> <span class="c15">blu</span> <span class="c14">‘be blue’ and</span>
<span class="c15">grin</span> <span class="c14">‘be blue/green’ are
much more commonly used” <a href="/contributions/17">(Faraclas 2013</a>). Similarly, <a href="/contributions/61">Fanakalo</a>
started out with the Zulu-derived</span> <span class="c15">luhlaza</span> <span class="c14">covering green and blue
(identity), then added English-derived</span> <span class="c15">bluwan</span> <span class="c14">‘blue’ (overlap)</span>
<span class="c14"> <a href="/contributions/61">(Mesthrie 2013)</a>,</span> <span class="c14">and may
at some point end up with</span> <span class="c15">luhlaza</span>
<span class="c14">‘green’ and</span> <span class="c15">bluwan</span> <span class="c14">‘blue’ (differentiation).
This last stage seems to have been reached by <a href="/contributions/37">Principense</a>,
presumably via the same trajectory: “Modern <a href="/contributions/37">Principense</a>
differentiates between ‘green’ and ‘blue’; however, only blue has a
corresponding ideophone, which suggests that formerly,</span>
<span class="c15">zulu</span> <span class="c14">[now ‘blue’] might
have referred to ‘blue’ as well as to ‘green’” <a href="/contributions/37">(Maurer 2013c)</a>. To
what extent these developments are influenced by lexifier/adstrate
pressure is a matter for future research.</span></p>
